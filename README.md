## Figure 5(b) Supplement
The figure shows the urban function corresponding to the energy consumption generated by all buildings in each grid. 
Efficient energy-saving urban planning aims to harmonize energy efficiency with the structural framework of urban development. For example, while lower energy consumption is a positive indicator of efficiency, it must be balanced against the risk of resulting in a less than ideal urban layout.

## Displays the relative energy intensity of all buildings in each of the 25*25 grids.
